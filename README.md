# Mint a NFT collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off

Based on a [BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so/) project where I learned to programmatically generate a NFT collection, write and deploy a smart contract in Solidity, and build a React dApp that let's users connect their wallets to interact with the NFTs.

Web3 client app available at [nft-starter-repo-final.emtr0.repl.co](https://nft-starter-repo-final.emtr0.repl.co/).

Connect your MetaMask wallet to mint a NFT!
